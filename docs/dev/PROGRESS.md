## v1.1.0: AI + Wallets

### AI Assistant

- [ ] Model picker and download flow: small offline-capable GGUF models (1–3B params, e.g. Gemma 2 2B), size/RAM shown before download
- [ ] On-device inference engine (e.g. `llama.rn` / `llama.cpp` bindings), fully offline, no server, no telemetry
- [ ] `src/core/ai/model-manager.ts`: download, checksum verify, store under app sandbox, delete/swap models
- [ ] `src/core/ai/inference.ts`: prompt/response loop against the loaded model, streamed token output
- [ ] Chat-style AI UI in `src/features/ai/ai-screen.tsx` (currently a placeholder): ask critical or general questions with zero network
- [ ] Conversation history kept local-only (MMKV)
- [ ] Low-end device fallback: block download if device lacks RAM/storage for the selected model

### Cashu Wallet

- [ ] `src/core/payments/cashu.ts`: token parse/embed/redeem with offline DLEQ validation
- [ ] `src/core/payments/nutzap.ts`: NIP-61 online zaps
- [ ] `src/store/wallet-store.ts`: MMKV-backed local Cashu proof storage (balances, dedup)
- [ ] Wallet UI in `src/features/wallet/wallet-screen.tsx`: balance view, send/receive over BLE, QR-based token exchange
- [ ] Nutzap send/receive when online, distinguished from the offline Cashu flow
- [ ] Mint management: add/remove trusted mints, per-mint balance breakdown

**Milestone:** A user with zero connectivity downloads a model once and asks it questions fully offline. A user sends and receives Cashu ecash entirely offline over BLE, and optionally sends a Nutzap when online.

## v1.2.0: Stabilization

No new features. Production bug fixes, race condition resolution in BLE and crypto layers, UI iteration from user feedback, and extended cross-device compatibility testing.

**Milestone:** Zero open P0/P1 bugs. BLE state machine stable across Pixel, Samsung, and Xiaomi device classes. Ready to expand to new platforms.

## v1.3.0: Plugin Integrations

- [ ] `SocialPlugin` and `PaymentPlugin` interfaces in `src/core/`
- [ ] AT Protocol (Bluesky): DID association, feed integration, post bridge, follow graph import
- [ ] ActivityPub (Fediverse): Actor construction, Mastodon inbox/outbox, outbound posting
- [ ] UPI Payment Plugin: deep link initiation, opt-in only, KYC disclosure required
- [ ] Plugin registry, per-plugin opt-in, strict data boundary and capability model

## v1.4.0: Web / Browser

- [ ] `react-native-web` build, Nostr-only (no BLE mesh in browser)
- [ ] Chrome and Edge supported; Firefox and Safari unsupported (Web Bluetooth limitation)
- [ ] PWA manifest, static hosting

## v1.5.0: Terminal / CLI

- [ ] Node.js build target for `src/core/`
- [ ] Linux BLE via `@abandonware/noble` (BlueZ)
- [ ] CLI interface + daemonize support + Docker image

## v1.6.0: Smartwatch Companions

- [ ] Apple Watch app (SwiftUI, WatchConnectivity): message notifications, quick reply, panic wipe trigger
- [ ] Wear OS app (Kotlin, Compose for Wear, Wearable Data Layer): notifications, quick reply, panic wipe trigger

## v1.7.0: Desktop (macOS + Windows)

- [ ] `react-native-macos` target, macOS BLE via CoreBluetooth
- [ ] `react-native-windows` target, Windows BLE via WinRT
- [ ] Mac App Store + Microsoft Store submission

## v1.8.0: SDK / Library

- [ ] Extract `src/core/` as `@airhop/core` npm package with stable public API
- [ ] Extract `AirhopBLEModule` as `@airhop/ble` React Native library
- [ ] WASM build of `@airhop/core`; Python (PyPI), Rust (crates.io), Go language SDKs
- [ ] Custom application profiles: emergency communications and high-anonymity reference builds
- [ ] Developer documentation and API reference

## v1.9.0: Security Hardening

- [ ] Third-party cryptographic audit (Cure53 or equivalent), covering `src/core/crypto/`, packet signing, key storage, and `@airhop/core` public API
- [ ] Second independent audit, BLE mesh layer, Nostr bridge, and `@airhop/ble` scope
- [ ] Fuzz testing: packet codec, fragment reassembly, malformed inputs
- [ ] Chaos testing: packet corruption, adversarial peers, replay attacks, Sybil flooding
- [ ] Remediate all audit findings; publish reports publicly

## v2.0.0: Flagship Interface

- [ ] Full UI/UX redesign with design system, accessibility audit (WCAG 2.1 AA), low-end device support
- [ ] Android API 21+ (Android 5.0) and iOS 14+ compatibility verified
- [ ] All docs kept in sync with every release; CVEs disclosed publicly with timeline and impact

## Blockers

_No hard blockers._

## Known Gaps (pre-v1.0.0)

| Gap                                                   | Detail                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | Impact                                                                        |
| ----------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Cross-language Noise XX test                          | JS ↔ bitchat-iOS interop test not yet run (requires a device test harness)                                                                                                                                                         | Deferred to v1.0.0 integration testing; MUST pass before App Store submission |
| ~~`AnnounceManager.buildPacket()` sends no TLV 0x04~~ | **Fixed:** `buildPacket()` now accepts optional `neighborIDs` and calls `buildAnnouncePayloadWithNeighbors()`. `start()` accepts a `getNeighborIDs` callback for live topology gossip.                                             | Topology gossip re-enabled; TLV 0x04 wire-compatible with bitchat             |
| ~~WiFi not in `MessageRouter` priority chain~~        | **Fixed:** `WiFiUnicastFn` added as tier-1 transport (tried before BLE when in range). Same Noise session is used for both transports. Falls back to BLE if WiFi returns false.                                                    | Full transport priority chain: WiFi → BLE → Nostr → Courier                   |
| ~~`DeviceMonitoringManager` not in native BLE~~       | **Fixed:** `PeerRegistry` now tracks `isDirect` per-peer with a 15s TTL for directly connected peers (matching bitchat's `DIRECT_PEER_TTL_MS`) vs 60s for mesh peers. `markDirect()` / `markIndirect()` called on BLE link events. | Anti-spam defense in place; direct-peer slot exhaustion mitigated             |
